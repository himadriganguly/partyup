# PartyUp

This project is developed for the startup that I planed and implemented, but unfortunately the idea didn't worked out. The application is developed in Ruby on Rails to create a platform for organizing any party, the organizer can post any requirements for caters, photographers etc within the city and all the vendors within that city who are registered in the application will be notified and then they can bid on the project and organizer can checke out the vendors portfolio their previous work, feedback etc to drill down their perfect match. This is just an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). My startup didn't worked out so I am sharing it as an open source so that if someone can get help from the code in anyway.
